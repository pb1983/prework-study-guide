## Description

This project is a tool to log and track the information learned in this course. Given the fast-paced nature of the bootcamp it will be an essential reference tool that will allow me to retain and utilize the takeaways from each lesson, rather than relying on memory alone.  Through this assignment I have aquired some of the foundational knowledge that will be the cornerstone of my developing skillset including basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax, as well as navigating Github and Git Bash.

## Usage

Each section of this study guide contains notes about the different programming languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and applications used to organize, store, and share code(Git). Key information from each lesson has been documented and stored in it's respective section. Chrome's DevTools feature can be used to select which of the aforementioned topics to study via the console, thanks to the Javascript code created during the prework assignment. This can be accessed by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) and selecting the "Console" tab in the window that opens in your browser.
